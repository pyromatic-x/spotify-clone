# Spotify Clone
[Live example](https://spotify-clone-1337.web.app/)

Spotify Clone is made with modern technologies to listen and search for music, artists, playlists etc. Unfortunately, the Spotify API does not provide the ability to get audio songs, so songs are hardcoded. Hope you enjoy my music taste. ðŸŽ¶

Sometimes you may facing errors. Especially if you're from a country which is not supported by Spotify itself. Best approach is to use VPN just to be sure everything will be working fine

What you can do in the app:
* Listen to predefined songs using bottom audio bar. Shuffle and loop songs. Change volume or open Queue page
* Queue page is a page where you can handle and see current queue of songs. You can lead there by clicking on ![Music Queue Icon](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/spotify-clone-1337.appspot.com/o/music_queue.png?alt=media&token=50f4033f-4519-423d-b1ea-f44319ebda72) in audio bar
* Filter/search albums, playlists and artists inside Your Library section. Also you can collapse left side menu by clicking on "Your Library". All items are obtained using Spotify API
